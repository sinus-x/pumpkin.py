or How to setup the server.

It is possible not to add the **Administrator** permission to the bot, and try to add only the neccessary permissions, or by trial and error. However, non-admin setup is not officially supported and there is no guarantee that newly required permissions will be announced.

The bot also assumes that you've enabled both privileged intents: Members and Presences.
